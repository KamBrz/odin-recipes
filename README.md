# odin-recipes

The follwing project proves my knowledge of the basic HTML.

I will display setting up a basic webpage with recipes,
building up the appropriate HTML structure.

The project will involve everything I've learnt thus far, including stucture,
insering titles, paragraphs, bolding, italics, links, images and lists
